String class:
    String is the most widely used class in Java. It can store sequence of characters . We should be using
    this class when we want to save memory, and we are not planing to make a lot of modifications
    to the String values.
StringBuilder Class:
    StringBuilder is exactly same as String class, but it is changeble (mutable).
