When we should use  String class:
     When we want to save as much memory as possible, and we ok if the program is slow.
When should we use String Builder class:
     When we want maximum speed, and we do not care how much memory our programs going to occupy.
What does it mean by String is immutable:
     It means String not changeable once created in the memory of the computer, and the reason
     they are immutable is because same memory cell can be shared across many variables and if we allow any of the
     variable to change the value it can break the complete system .
