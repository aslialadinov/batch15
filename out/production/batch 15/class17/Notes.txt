Access Modifiers:
      These modifiers control accessibility of instance or static fields,
      methods and classes. There are four access levels and there are three access modifier keywords.
      1) private 2)default 3)protected 4) public
 Constructors:
     Constructors in Java help us create objects easy or initialize the instance fields
     of a class in a better way.
 Rules:
     1) They are similar to methods, but they do not have return types.
     2) They have same name as class name.
     3) We can use all the access modifiers with the constructors.
     4) Static keyword is not allowed with constructors.
