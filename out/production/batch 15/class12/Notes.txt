OOP - object oriented programing:
      It is just a way of writing code that follows certain rules or guidelines.
      We create classes that have attributes/properties/fields and methods/function/behaviourism.
Why we should learn OOP?
      1) It simplifies the software development and maintenance( adding new features changing the existing code ).
      2) Code duplication is reduced.
      3) It also helps us represent something from real life with the help of classes and objects.
Class:
      is a blueprint or a design from which actual real life objects are created. Computer uses a class to check what that class can do

  Object:
        Objects are created from classes, and we can use them to call methods and prorties from those classes.
   NOte:
       Inside the sequence does not matter you can call
