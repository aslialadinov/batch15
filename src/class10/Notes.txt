Arrays in java:

     Arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable. We use indexes to get back the values.
     Why we should learn the Arrays:
     If we have to store a lot of values. It becomes very hard to manage a lot of variables.
     Syntax of Arrays:
     We can create arrays in two different ways.
     First way of creating arrays:
     Data type[] arr={element 1, element 2, element 3,}
     System.out.println(arr[0])
     Second way of creating arrays:
     Datatype[] arr=new Datatype[Size]
     Note:
     Other than using loops we can also use below syntax
          int[] arr={10,13,20,25,45,50};
             //Below code prints all the elements from an array without a loop
             System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
         }
