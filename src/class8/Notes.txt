Loops help us repeat instructions in code for example if we have to print number from 1 to 100 .
One way we can do this is by copying and pasting which is bad and not skilable other way of doing this is using loops.

There are 4 types of loops:
1) while
2) do while
3) for loop
4) enhanced for loops

Break keyword:
Break keyword is used to stop a loop just like condition that we use inside a loop.
 Continue keyword:
 Is used to skip all the code written inside the body of the loop.
 We should always use with if conditions
