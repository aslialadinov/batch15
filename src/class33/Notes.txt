Exception:
    Exception is an unwanted behaviour which occurs at
    run time and makes our programs terminate abruptly.

Exception handling:
    Exception handling is a mechanism that allows us to avoid
    runtime errors and  helps us convert complex error messages
    to something simpler that a normal user can understand.

How do we implement exception handling in java?
    We have new keywords and new blocks which allows us to handle exception in java
    Blocks of code: 1. try  2. catch  3. finally
    Keywords :4. throw   5. throws

try Block:
    in try block we write the code which may throw exception

catch Block:
    It contains the backup code, the code that we want to execute in
    case of failure. it can also contain code to simplify the error
    messages it can also contain the code which might send a notification
    or an email to the developers or admins in case of failure
how it works:
    We can have multiple catch blocks with one try block. Each handling
    different error. We can also  put the last catch block with Exception
    class so that if something goes wrong and there is no specific catch block
    to handle it the Exception one will handle it!
finally block:
        Finally block is always executed no matter what happens in the try
        block or the catch block
        We should put cleanup code inside the finally blocks like closing a
        browser closing the database connection etc.
